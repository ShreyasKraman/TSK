Tuberculosis Seva Kendra - Spring, Hibernate App

Tuberculosis is a world known deadly disease which is completely curable according to the medications available in the current century. However, the mortality rate due to tuberculosis is still high in developing  countries  as well as  in  developed  countries  too! One of the  main reasons  behind  this  is  because  patients  do  not  follow  up  with  doctor  once  detected  with tuberculosis. And the other reason being co-morbidity (presence of another primary disease apart  from  tuberculosis).  To  solve  this  problem,  Tuberculosis  Seva  Kendra  was  built.  This system will automatically assign follow up appointments to the patients once medical report is  uploaded.  Once  medical  report  is  fetched  the  system  parses  it  and  stores  the  relevant information  in  the  database  so  that  it  can  be  used  for  analysis  as  well  as  for  prioritizing appointments. Further this data can be useful to store medicine combination which can be used to cure conditions of co-morbidity.
